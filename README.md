## Introduction

**nf-core/TPOXX_AmpSeq** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for mpox F13L amplicon sequencing. It generates reference-assembled consensus sequences, variant reports, (['NextClade'](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade)) outputs including clade and lineage, and multiple quality control metrics. A schematic of general proccesses is below:

<!-- Include the pipeline visualization graphic here -->
![Pipeline Visualization](/assets/visualization.svg)

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

General Pipeline Steps:
1. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Sequencing Toolkit (['SEQTK'](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk)) to trim primers.
3. Trimming of raw reads and filtering low reads counts using (['TRIMMOMATIC'](https://github.com/usadellab/Trimmomatic)).
4. Maps raw reads to reference (['Minimap2'](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)) and generates a reference-based consensus (['IVAR consensus'](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar)).  
5. Alignment files and coverage information generated by (['SAMTOOLS'](https://github.com/samtools/samtools)). 
6. Consensus polishing via (['MEDAKA'](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka)). 
7. Variant table generated via BAM through (['IVAR variants'](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar)).
8. (['NextClade'](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade)) generated clade assignment, mutation calling, phylogenetic placement, and quality control for Mpox.  
2. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

Repository needs to be cloned using git clone

	git clone https://git.biotech.cdc.gov/utx1/TPOXX_AmpSeq.git


Your sample sheet should look something like this:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
CONTROL_REP2,AEG589A2_MERGED.fastq
```

A script is available to create a samplesheet in the required format in /assets/samplesheet.sh. Run it in the working directory with FASTQ files, ending with a "/" symbol. This script assumes all reads have already been basecalled. 


Now, you can run the pipeline using:


```bash
nextflow run nf-core/TPOXX_AmpSeq \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --resume <#if applicable> \
   --fasta <reference_fasta_path> \
   --bed_file <bed_path> \
   --fai_file <fai_path> \
   --gff_file <gff_path> \
   --mmi_file <mmi_path> \
   --nextclade_dataset_name 'nextstrain/mpox/all-clades'
```

Reference MT903344.1 is provided in /assets/genome/

An additional script (/assets/table_summary.sh) can be ran in the nextflow output directory to generate a table of total read counts, mapped reads count, average coverage, and average read length. The script will also list all SNPs (any alternate frequncy) and indels (alternate frequency >50%) found in the (['IVAR variants'](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar)) report; it will detail the mutation with positions corresponding to the reference, the alternate amino acid change, the mutational frequency, and coverage at the mutation site. 


> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/TPOXX_AmpSeq/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/TPOXX_AmpSeq/parameters).

## Overview

This NextFlow pipeline was designed to generate and analyze consensus sequences of two targetted amplicon regions. Each region correlates to primers designed to differentiate mpox clade designations. This analysis gives an alternate to whole genome sequencing while maintaining a high level of confidence to efficient clade assignment.
